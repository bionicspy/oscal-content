A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver.

For most organizations, the default settings are sufficient.\nImpact: If you configure the **Log on as a batch job** setting through domain-based Group Policies, the computer will not be able to assign the user right to accounts that are used for scheduled jobs in the Task Scheduler. If you install optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you might need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components. For example, IIS requires assignment of this user right to the `IIS_WPG` group and the `IUSR_`_(ComputerName)_, `ASPNET`, and `IWAM_`_(ComputerName)_ accounts. If this user right is not assigned to this group and these accounts, IIS will be unable to run some COM objects that are necessary for proper functionality."
