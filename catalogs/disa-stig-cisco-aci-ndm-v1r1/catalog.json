Information system and security-related documentation contains information pertaining to system configuration and security settings. If this information were not backed up, and a system failure were to occur, the security settings would be difficult to reconfigure quickly and accurately. Maintaining a backup of information system and security-related documentation provides for a quicker recovery time when system outages occur. This control requires the Cisco ACI to support the organizational central backup process for user account information associated with the Cisco ACI. This function may be provided by the Cisco ACI itself; however, the preferred best practice is a centralized backup rather than each Cisco ACI performing discrete backups.\n\nWith ACI, all components of the ACI Fabric are treated as one entity (leaves, spines, APIC controllers). The ACI Fabric configuration, while made up of different managed objects, is combined into one tar/gz zipfile, which greatly improves the configuration backup process, as well as the configuration restoration process. Finally, the backups can be configured as one-time backup jobs, or they can be scheduled in a daily or weekly scheduler to export the entire Fabric configuration to a remote location (i.e., external server) using SCP, FTP, or SFTP. Cisco ACI allows administrators to perform on-demand and periodic snapshots. Those snapshots can be saved either locally or in a remote location. Cisco ACI configuration contains many sensitive details, including passwords and secrets. Therefore, backup configuration must be properly secured and stored in a secure remote location, ensuring that sensitive information on the configuration files is not disclosed. Set the AES passphrase immediately after fabric bring-up and store the passphrase in a safe location external to the APIC. This passphrase must be provided by the administrator to unencrypt the configuration backup needed to restore the fabric should a disaster happen."

This control is particularly important protection against the insider threat. With robust centralized management, audit records for administrator account access to the organization's Cisco ACIs can be more readily analyzed for trends and anomalies. The alternative method of defining administrator accounts on each device exposes the device configuration to remote access authentication attacks and system administrators with multiple authenticators for each Cisco ACI.\n\nAPIC policies manage the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) functions of the Cisco ACI fabric. The combination of user privileges, roles, and domains with access rights inheritance enables administrators to configure AAA functions at the managed object level in a granular fashion. Creating a user and assigning a role to that user does not enable access rights. It is necessary to also assign the user to one or more security domains. By default, the ACI fabric includes two special precreated domains:\n- \"All\" allows access to the entire MIT.\n- \"Infra\" allows access to fabric infrastructure objects/subtrees, such as fabric access policies.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000149-NDM-000247, SRG-APP-000001-NDM-000200"

When performing a regular firmware upgrade for the entire fabric, delete the dedicated update group used for the SMU patch installation and add the node back to one of the original groups. If all the nodes in the existing group need the SMU patch, reuse the same update group without creating a new update group.\n\n1.

In the Work pane, click the upgrade group created. The Node Firmware Update dialog displays with information for the upgrade group.\n4. When the status for the switches is \"Ready to Install\", click \"Actions\".\n\nInstall and Reload: The switches reboot after the SMU patch gets installed.

Choose this action to install multiple SMU patches and if this patch is not the final patch. In this case, repeat this entire procedure for each additional patch and continue to choose Install and Skip Reload until the final patch is installed. For the final patch, choose Install and Reload.

Remote authentication server is required, but roles can be created, deleted, or associated access privileges to nodes and resources update in the APIC. To create a new role with reduced permissions, do the following:\n\nTo create or modify roles:\n1. From the GUI, navigate to Admin >> AAA >> Security Management >> Roles.\n2. Create custom roles with appropriate privileges (e.g., read-write access to specific objects).\n3. Associate users with these roles, allowing them to perform specific tasks within the ACI fabric.\n\nNote: This procedure may use preconfigured rules and privileges. Security Domains, Rules, and Custom Roles may also be used depending on the desired architecture and complexity of the implementation.

The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise of, and unauthorized access to, sensitive information. All DOD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.\n\nSecurity domains allow fabric administrators to expose resources selectively to a set of users and provide those users with the required level of permissions to read and modify those resources. By using security domains, multiple sets of users can share the underlying infrastructure while having separated management access to their resources.\n\nAlthough out of scope for this STIG, the authentication server will also need to be configured with the security groups or access levels available on the Cisco ACIs and convey that information to the AAA operator of the Cisco ACI. Once the AAA broker identifies the user persona on the centralized directory service, the user's security group memberships can be retrieved. The AAA operator will then create a mapping that links target security groups from the directory service to the appropriate security groups or access levels on the Cisco ACI. Once these mappings are configured, authorizations can happen dynamically, based on each user's directory service group membership.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000033-NDM-000212, SRG-APP-000329-NDM-000287, SRG-APP-000177-NDM-000263, SRG-APP-000910-NDM-000300"

Auditing account creation provides the necessary reconciliation that account management procedures are being followed. Without this audit trail, personnel without the proper authorization may gain access to critical network nodes.\n\nSystem messages are created by various sources, such as the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) or the spine and leaf switches in the ACI fabric. System messages from the switches can be generated by either of the following processes: the underlying NX-OS operating system of the spine and leaf switches or the ACI-related processes in the switch. This requirement sets the default logging level on the ACI to 7.

Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks, such as clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds.
