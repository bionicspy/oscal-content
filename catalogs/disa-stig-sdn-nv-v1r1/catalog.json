This information is provided to the switches via SDN management plane protocols such as Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and Open vSwitch Database Management Protocol (OVSDB). The latter provides configuration support for OpenFlow-enabled switches such as Open vSwitch, as well as many vendor switches.\n\nIf a switch within the SDN infrastructure were to receive fictitious information from a rogue management system, the physical network topology could be altered by shutting down interfaces. Legitimate traffic could be dropped by deploying access control lists to active interfaces. By altering the network topology, the attacker would have the ability to force traffic to bypass security controls. Spoofed management plane traffic generated by a rogue management system could result in a denial-of-service attack on the switches, resulting in a network outage. Hence, it is imperative that all SDN management plane traffic is secured by encrypting the traffic using a FIPS-validated cryptographic module."

The controller uses node and link state discovery information to calculate and determine optimum pathing within the SDN network infrastructure based on application, business, and security policies. Operating in the proactive flow instantiation mode, the SDN controller pre-populates forwarding tables to the forwarding devices. \n\nAt times, the SDN controller must function in reactive flow instantiation mode; that is, when a forwarding device receives a packet for a flow not found in its forwarding table, it must send or punt it to the controller to receive forwarding instructions. Upon receiving the punted packet, the controller must determine how to forward the packet, create a rule, and populate a new forwarding table to the forwarding device. High rates of punted packets result in excessive controller CPU and memory utilization. Hence, a denial-of-serve attack targeting the SDN controller can be perpetrated either inadvertently or maliciously, involving high rates of packets for new flows that must be punted to the controller."

Each Layer 2 overlay network is known as a VXLAN segment and is identified by a unique segment ID called a VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI). \n\nThe VXLAN network enables virtual machines with the same VNI deployed on different hosts to communicate with each other. Virtual machines are identified uniquely by the combination of the MAC addresses of their virtual network interface card (NIC) and VNI. Hence, it is possible to have duplicate MAC addresses within the SDN infrastructure while in different VXLAN segments. Within the VXLAN architecture, virtual tunnel endpoints (VTEPs) perform the encapsulation and de-encapsulation of the layer-2 traffic. The VXLAN segments are independent of the underlying network topology; conversely, the underlying IP network between VTEPs is independent of the VXLAN overlay. It routes the encapsulated packets based on the outer IP address header, which has the initiating VTEP as the source IP address and the terminating VTEP as the destination IP address. \n\nThe VTEP must be configured with the appropriate VNIs to enable the VTEP to build forwarding tables for active VXLAN segments (Layer 2 domains) by learning MAC addresses per VNI packet flows."

Each Layer 2 overlay network is known as a VXLAN segment and is identified by a unique segment ID called a VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI). \n\nThe VXLAN network enables virtual machines with the same VNI deployed on different hosts to communicate with each other. Virtual machines are identified uniquely by the combination of the MAC addresses of their virtual network interface card (NIC) and VNI. Hence, it is possible to have duplicate MAC addresses within the SDN infrastructure while in different VXLAN segments. Within the VXLAN architecture, virtual tunnel endpoints (VTEPs) perform the encapsulation and de-encapsulation of the layer-2 traffic. The VXLAN segments are independent of the underlying network topology; conversely, the underlying IP network between VTEPs is independent of the VXLAN overlay. It routes the encapsulated packets based on the outer IP address header, which has the initiating VTEP as the source IP address and the terminating VTEP as the destination IP address.\n\nVTEP-enabled switches will determine the VNI to insert into the VXLAN header based on the 802.1Q VLAN tag of each frame received from the hypervisor host connected via trunk link or the VLAN assignment of an access switchport. The mapping of VLAN to VNI is configured on the switch. Since the VNI is used to segregate all Layer 2 domains, the correct mapping is critical to ensure all traffic for each Layer 2 domain within the SDN infrastructure is forwarded correctly and that broadcast and multicast traffic does not leak into the wrong domain."

For example, a vPC consists of two vPC peer switches connected by a vPC peer link. A vPC domain is formed by the two switches; one switch is primary and the other is secondary. A switch can only be part of one vPC domain, and only two switches can make up a vPC domain.\n\nA vPC allows links that are physically connected to two different switches to appear as a single port channel to a third device, which can be another switch or a server that supports Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) as defined in IEEE 802.1AX, 802.1aq, and 802.3ad. With vPC deployment, the loopback interface that is acting as the source-interface for the VTEP will use the secondary IP address to function as the anycast IP address if the hypervisor host is dual-attached through the vPC. When a host is single-attached (orphan port), the VXLAN-encapsulated traffic will be sent using the loopback\u2019s primary address."

The gateway establishes routing adjacencies between the virtual routers and physical routers. The gateway can also filter the north-south traffic to enforce security policies for communication between the physical and virtual workloads. \n\nImplementing the edge gateway in either active/standby or equal-cost multipath (ECMP) mode ensures there is always a virtual router to forward north-south traffic, assuming there is always a routing adjacency with a router in the physical network infrastructure. Having an adjacency with only one physical router creates a single point of failure regardless of the number of links deployed, there would be no connectivity between the virtual and physical workloads if a node failure occurred. Hence, it is imperative that each edge gateway is deployed with connectivity to two physical routers."
