Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.\n\nThis requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.\n\nThe capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.\n\nThe organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, two might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.\n\nSessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms."

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. \n \nSuccessful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. \n \nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. \n \nThis requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If SQL Server does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system.

When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, users can opt to have these provisioned for them. These automatically generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts. Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID with the same name. The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name. Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts provides tighter control, because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running and not in any other context. However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account. For more on this topic, refer to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143504(v=sql.130).aspx. \n\nNote 2: Tips for adding a service SID/virtual account to a folder's permission list:\n\n1.

NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2 specifies the preferred configurations for government systems.\n\nReferences:\nTLS Support 1.2 for SQL Server: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3135244 \nTLS Registry Settings:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/tls/tls-registry-settings"

Control of information in shared resources is also referred to as object reuse.\n\nWhen IFI is in use, the deleted disk content is overwritten only as new data is written to the files. For this reason, the deleted content might be accessed by an unauthorized principal until some other data writes on that specific area of the data file.\n\nHistorically, transaction log files couldn't be initialized instantaneously. However, starting with SQL Server 2022 (16.x) (all editions), transaction log autogrowth events up to 64 MB can benefit from instant file initialization. The default auto growth size increment for new databases is 64 MB. Transaction log file autogrowth events larger than 64 MB can't benefit from instant file initialization.\n\nInstant file initialization is allowed for transaction log growth on databases that have transparent data encryption (TDE) enabled, due to the nature of how the transaction log file is expanded, and the fact that the transaction log is written into in a serial fashion."

Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, precompiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).\n\nWhen dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:\n- Allow strings as input only when necessary. \n- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.\n- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.\n- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.\n- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ \n- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.\n- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.\n- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input. \n- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.\n- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.\n- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.\n- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.\n- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.\n\nThis calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers.

Nonprivileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from nonprivileged users. \n \nA privileged function in SQL Server/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to:  \nCREATE \nALTER \nDROP \nGRANT \nREVOKE \nDENY \n \nThere may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include: \nTRUNCATE TABLE; \nDELETE, or \nDELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or \nDELETE without a WHERE clause; \n \nUPDATE or \nUPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or \nUPDATE without a WHERE clause; \n \nAny SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal. \n \nDepending on the capabilities of SQL Server and the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these."

Enforcement action methods may be as simple as denying access to a file based on the application of file permissions (access restriction). Audit items may consist of lists of actions blocked by access restrictions or changes identified after the fact.\n\nChanges in the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles, as well as privileged activity, must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized elevation or restriction of privileges could go undetected. Elevated privileges give users access to information and functionality that they should not have; restricted privileges wrongly deny access to authorized users.\n \nA privileged function in this context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In a SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, GRANT, REVOKE, and DENY. \n \nThere may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples in SQL include TRUNCATE TABLE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE (to a security table executed by a user other than a security principal).\n \nDepending on the capabilities of SQL Server and the design of the database and associated applications, audit logging may be achieved by means of DBMS auditing features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these. \n \nNote that it is particularly important to audit, and tightly control, any action that weakens the implementation of this requirement, since the objective is to have a complete audit trail of all administrative activity.\n \nTo aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to track failed attempts in addition to the successful ones.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000381-DB-000361, SRG-APP-000495-DB-000326, SRG-APP-000495-DB-000327, SRG-APP-000495-DB-000328, SRG-APP-000495-DB-000329, SRG-APP-000499-DB-000330, SRG-APP-000499-DB-000331, SRG-APP-000504-DB-000354, SRG-APP-000504-DB-000355"

Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. \n \nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). \n \nThis requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period used must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process. \n \nSQL Server will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update.

It avoids the need to hard-assign port numbers to the instances and to set and maintain those port numbers in client systems. It enables administrators and authorized users to discover database management system instances, and the databases they support, over the network. SQL Server uses the SQL Server Browser service to enumerate instances of the Database Engine installed on the computer. This enables client applications to browse for a server, and helps clients distinguish between multiple instances of the Database Engine on the same computer.\n\nThis convenience also presents the possibility of unauthorized individuals gaining knowledge of the available SQL Server resources. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the SQL Server Browser is needed. Typically, if only a single instance is installed, using the default name (MSSQLSERVER) and port assignment (1433), the Browser is not adding any value. The more complex the installation, the more likely SQL Server Browser is to be helpful. \n\nThis requirement is not intended to prohibit use of the Browser service in any circumstances. It calls for administrators and management to consider whether the benefits of its use outweigh the potential negative consequences of it being used by an attacker to browse the current infrastructure and retrieve a list of running SQL Server instances."
