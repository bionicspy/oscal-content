Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Registration authenticates and authorizes endpoints with the Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Session Manager.\n\nFor most VoIP systems, registration is the process of centrally recording the user ID, endpoint MAC address, service/policy profile with two-stage authentication prior to authorizing the establishment of the session and user service. The event of successful registration creates the session record immediately. VC systems register using a similar process with a gatekeeper. Auto-registration is an automatic means of detecting and registering a Voice Video Endpoint on the network with a session manager and then downloading its configuration to the instrument. Auto-registration allows unauthorized instruments to be added or moved without authorization, possibly allowing theft of services or other malicious attack. Configuring the firewall to deny registration (port 1719, etc.) is another layer of defense."

These URLs are translated to IP addresses by a DNS server. The use of URLs in this manner permits an endpoint to find the server it is looking for in the event the server\u2019s IP address is changed. This also permits the endpoint to locate its assigned or home call controller from a remote location on a network that is not their home network. While all of this adds flexibility to the system and the endpoint\u2019s location, it also exposes the endpoint and the home system to DNS vulnerabilities. Additionally, the home VVoIP system must expose critical IP address and domain information to the DNS system. If the DNS system is exposed to the DNS servers that support the enterprise data network or the internet, this information and exposure of the system is, or may be, extended to the world. This provides information that can be used to attack or compromise the VVoIP system. \n\nWhen using DNS within a VVoIP system so that endpoints can find various servers in the network, the DNS server should be dedicated to the VVoIP system. Furthermore, this DNS server should have limited or no interaction with the DNS server used by the data portion of the LAN/CAN or a publicly accessible DNS server. This will protect the VVoIP system\u2019s DNS server from some of the vulnerabilities inherent in DNS servers that serve data endpoints and that are connected to the wider enterprise networks or the internet.\n\nWhile the use of DNS adds IP addressing flexibility to a VVoIP system, it is not necessary to use it for systems within the local LAN. VVoIP servers and infrastructure devices are required to be statically addressed. Therefore, the endpoints can be configured with these known IP addresses rather than URLs. A remote endpoint is required to connect to the home enclave via a VPN. It receives an internal LAN address and therefore becomes a part of the LAN and can directly reach its servers using their IP address. A URL is not required. The only time a URL might be required is in the event the endpoint is required to find a server such as a directory server that is somewhere on the WAN. This is the case in the VoSIP system on SIPRNet. Not using DNS in a VVoIP system eliminates its exposure to DNS vulnerabilities and attacks effected using information obtained from the DNS. \n\nNOTE: In the event a DNS server is implemented within the VVoIP system, the DNS STIG must be applied to the server."

An authentication process resists replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message. Techniques used to address this include protocols using nonces (e.g., numbers generated for a specific one time use) or challenges (e.g., TLS, WS_Security). Additional techniques include time-synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators. \n\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability was demonstrated on a SIP-based IP phone by adding scripting code to the \"From\" field in the SIP invite. Upon receiving the invite, the embedded code was executed by the IP phone embedded web server to download additional malicious code."

Unless required for legacy use, DOD systems should not be configured to use SHA-1 for integrity of remote access sessions.\n\nThis requirement focuses on communications protection for the application session rather than for the network packet and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of information transmitted. Depending on the required degree of confidentiality and integrity, web services/SOA will require the use of mutual authentication (two-way/bidirectional).\n\nThis requirement applies only to network elements that act as an intermediary for individual sessions (e.g., proxy, ALG, or SSL VPN)."

Preserving information system state information also facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption to mission-essential processes. \n\nAn example is a firewall that blocks all traffic rather than allowing all traffic when a firewall component fails (e.g., fail closed and do not forward traffic). This prevents an attacker from forcing a failure of the system in order to obtain access. This applies to the configuration of the functionality of the element (e.g., firewall, IDPS, or router).

For example, what is normal activity during operational hours can indicate hostile activity if it occurs during off hours. Depending on mission needs and conditions, usage restrictions based on conditions and circumstances may be critical to limit access to resources and data to comply with operational or mission access control requirements. Thus, the network element must be configured to enforce the specific conditions or circumstances under which application accounts can be used (e.g., by restricting usage to certain days of the week, time of day, or specific durations of time).\n\nLimiting access to the voice/video network by work hours and work week mitigates the risk of unauthorized access to the system outside of duty hours, reducing misuse or abuse of the system and its resources. Areas requiring service during other times may be identified. However, it is essential that endpoints be allowed access to emergency services at all times."

Centralized management of audit records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as the backup and archiving of those records. Network components requiring centralized audit log management must have the capability to support centralized management.\n\nSession records for Voice Video systems are generally handled in a similar fashion to audit records for other systems and are used for billing, usage analysis, and record support for actions taken.

DOD supporting C2 communications relies on the implementation of MLPP to ensure that flag officers and senior staff are provided higher priority for communications than other users. For VoIP and videoconferencing systems, Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Session Managers must communicate using protocols and services that provide expedited packets to users and other systems. Additionally, Quality of Service (QoS) is an effective security safeguard used to ensure network communications availability based on priority. \n\nDifferent applications and other network traffic have unique requirements and toleration levels for delay, jitter, bandwidth, packet loss, and availability. To manage the multitude of applications and services, a network requires a QoS framework to differentiate traffic and provide a method to avoid and manage network congestion. When network congestion occurs, all traffic has an equal chance of being dropped. A QoS implementation categorizes network traffic into classes and provides priority treatment based on the classification."

Each of these protocol suites uses different methodologies for securing transmitted signaling. The H.323 protocol suite relies on the H.235 series, which describes security within H.323, including security for both signaling and media. For SIP protocol, the DOD has created the AS-SIP protocol, which provides for implementing Transport Layer Security (TLS), Multi-Level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP), reliance on Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for media streams, and Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) for traffic management through priority packet routing. To secure SCCP, TLS must be implemented with the protocol.\n\nNote: It is expected that this requirement be used to address each protocol individually. A separate STIG requirement for each protocol used identifying the methods to protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted control information (including registration files) and media streams must be produced."

                "prose": "Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Use of passwords for authentication is intended only for limited situations and should not be used as a replacement for two-factor CAC-enabled authentication.\n\nAlthough allowed by SP800-131Ar2 for some applications, SHA-1 is considered a compromised hashing standard and is being phased out of use by industry and government standards. Unless required for legacy use, DOD systems should not be configured to use SHA-1 for integrity of remote access sessions.\n\nThe information system must specify the hash algorithm used for authenticating passwords. Implementation of this requirement requires configuration of FIPS-approved cipher block algorithm and block cipher modes for encryption.\n\nPreshared key cipher suites may only be used in networks where both the client and server belong to the same organization. Cipher suites using preshared keys must not be used with TLS 1.0 or 1.1 and must not be used with TLS 1.2 when a government client or server communicates with nongovernment systems. This requirement applies to all accounts, including authentication server, AAA, and local accounts such as the root account and the account of last resort.\n\nThis requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the function of the device (e.g., Transport Layer Security [TLS] Virtual Private Network [VPN] or Application Layer Gateway [ALG]). This does not apply to authentication for the purpose of configuring the device itself (management)."

Unapproved mechanisms used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified, and therefore cannot be relied on to provide confidentiality or integrity and DOD data may be compromised.\n\nVoice Video protocol suites include SIP, SCCP, and H.323. Each of these protocol suites uses different methodologies for securing transmitted signaling. The H.323 protocol suite relies on the H.235 series, which describes security within H.323, including security for both signaling and media. For SIP protocol, the DOD has created the AS-SIP protocol, which provides for implementing Transport Layer Security (TLS), Multi-Level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP), reliance on Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for media streams, and Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) for traffic management through priority packet routing. To secure SCCP, TLS must be implemented with the protocol."

Passwords should be used only in limited situations.\n\nExamples of situations where a user ID and password might be used include:\n\n- When the user does not use a CAC and is not a current DOD employee, member of the military, or DOD contractor.\n\n- When a user has been officially designated as temporarily unable to present a CAC for some reason (lost, damaged, not yet issued, broken card reader) (i.e., Temporary Exception User) and to satisfy urgent organizational needs must be temporarily permitted to use user ID/password authentication until the problem with CAC use has been remedied.\n\n- When the application is publicly available and/or hosting publicly releasable data requiring some degree of need-to-know protection.\n\nIf the password is already encrypted and not a plaintext password, this meets this requirement. Implementation of this requirement requires configuration of FIPS-approved cipher block algorithm and block cipher modes for encryption. This method uses a one-way hashing encryption algorithm with a salt value to validate a user's password without having to store the actual password. Performance and time required to access are factors that must be considered, and the one-way hash is the most feasible means of securing the password and providing an acceptable measure of password security.\n\nThis requirement applies to all accounts including authentication server; Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA), and local accounts, including the root account, and the account of last resort."
