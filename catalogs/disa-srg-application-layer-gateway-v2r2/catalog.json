Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.\n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies.

Organizations implementing CDS must follow the DoD-required process of testing, baselining, and risk assessment to ensure the rigor and accuracy necessary to rely upon a CDS for cross domain security.\n\nEnforcement occurs in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).\n\nThis requirement is primarily used by organizations with cross domain solution needs.

The organization must determine which functions and services are required to perform the content filtering and other necessary core functionality for each component of the ALG. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.\n\nThe primary function of an ALG is to provide application specific content filtering and/or proxy services. The ALG application suite may integrate related content filtering and analysis services and tools (e.g., IPS, proxy, malware inspection, black/white lists). Some gateways may also include email scanning, decryption, caching, and DLP services. However, services and capabilities which are unrelated to this primary functionality must not be installed (e.g., DNS, email client or server, FTP server, or web server).\n\nNext Generation ALGs (NGFW) and Unified Threat Management (UTM) ALGs integrate functions which have been traditionally separated. These products integrate content filtering features to provide more granular policy filtering. There may be operational drawbacks to combining these services into one device. Another issue is that NGFW and UTM products vary greatly with no current definitive industry standard."

These attacks can be detected by matching observed communications traffic with patterns of known attacks and monitoring for anomalies in traffic volume/type.\n\nThe ALG must include protection against DoS attacks that originate from inside the enclave which can affect either internal or external systems. These attacks may use legitimate or rogue endpoints from inside the enclave. These attacks can be simple \"floods\" of traffic to saturate circuits or devices, malware that consumes CPU and memory on a device or causes it to crash, or a configuration issue that disables or impairs the proper function of a device. For example, an accidental or deliberate misconfiguration of a routing table can misdirect traffic for multiple networks.\n\nTo comply with this requirement, the ALG must monitor outbound traffic for indications of known and unknown DoS attacks. Audit log capacity management along with techniques which prevent the logging of redundant information during an attack also guard against DoS attacks."

Many of the protections may provide defenses before vulnerabilities are discovered and rules or blacklist updates are distributed by anti-virus or malicious code solution vendors.\n\nTo monitor for and detect known prohibited mobile code or approved mobile code that violates permitted usage requirements, the ALG must implement policy filters, rules, signatures, and anomaly analysis."

This prevents an attacker from forcing a failure of the system in order to obtain access.\n\nThis applies to the configuration of the gateway or network traffic security function of the device.

Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a system and between interconnected systems. Security attributes may be used to manage information flow control.\n\nOrganization-defined information and organization-defined information flow control policies for CDS systems depend on the environment, data, and security boundaries. Organizations implementing CDS must follow the DoD-required process of testing, baselining, and risk assessment to ensure the rigor and accuracy necessary to rely upon a CDS for cross domain security.\n\nInformation flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes associated with information (data content and data structure) and/or source/destination objects. The ALG uses the result of the attribute-object comparison to take an organization-defined action based on configured rules. Security attributes most often include source and destination addresses."

Human reviews may also be employed as deemed necessary by organizations.\n\nThe cross domain solution will display the data which requires human review to the authorized reviewer in its native form (i.e., consistent with how it would be displayed by the application that created the data). The system will require a response from the authorized reviewer prior to taking action on the transfer data and then take appropriate actions as indicated by the reviewer (e.g., reject, forward, reply, etc.), but do not allow the reviewer to circumvent any additional filtering mechanisms.\n\nOrganization-defined information flows and conditions used as part of a CDS system depend on the environment, data, and security boundaries. Organizations implementing CDS must follow the DoD-required process of testing, baselining, and risk assessment to ensure the rigor and accuracy necessary to rely upon a CDS for cross domain security."

                "prose": "Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into an application's data entry fields and the application is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application behavior potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.\n\nNetwork devices with the functionality to perform application layer inspection may be leveraged to validate data content of network communications. Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software typically follows well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If network elements use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.\n\nThis requirement applies to gateways and firewalls that perform content inspection or have higher-layer proxy functionality."

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.\n\nSession termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.\n\nThis capability is typically reserved for specific system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional trigger events based on specific mission needs. Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, targeted responses to certain types of incidents and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.\n\nThis policy only applies to gateways (e.g., identity management or authentication gateways) that provide user account services as part of the intermediary services."

For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of DoS attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to DoS events."

Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software as well as custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.\nIn situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations rely on other types of controls, including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that, in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, the detection of malicious downloads, or the detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files."
