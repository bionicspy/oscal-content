Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. Applications need to track periods of user inactivity and disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be hijacked, leading to a data compromise. \n\nTo address access requirements, many application developers choose to integrate their applications with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the application developer to offload those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality. \n\nThis policy does not apply to either emergency accounts or infrequently used accounts. Infrequently used accounts are local login administrator accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available. Emergency accounts are administrator accounts created in response to crisis situations.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.users/get-mguser?view=graph-powershell-1.0\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/signinactivity?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties\n\nFor any PowerShell scripts that are Graph, note that Graph endpoints differ depending on where the tenant is located.\n- For commercial tenants, graph endpoints are graph.microsoft.com.\n- For GCC High tenants (IL4), graph endpoints are graph.microsoft.us.\n- For DOD tenants (IL5), graph endpoints are dod-graph.microsoft.us.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000025, SRG-APP-000163"

If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.\n\nEmergency accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.\n\nTo address access requirements, many application developers choose to integrate their applications with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the application developer to offload those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality."
