These attacks can be detected by matching observed communications traffic with patterns of known attacks and monitoring for anomalies in traffic volume/type.\n\nTo comply with this requirement, the IDPS must inspect outbound traffic for indications of known and unknown DoS attacks. Sensor log capacity management along with techniques which prevent the logging of redundant information during an attack also guard against DoS attacks. This requirement is used in conjunction with other requirements which require configuration of security policies, signatures, rules, and anomaly detection techniques and are applicable to both inbound and outbound traffic."

For example, some network-based attacks have used packets that should not exist in normal communications, such as sending some fragments of a packet but not the first fragment, or sending packet fragments that overlap each other. These, and other types of packet fragmentation, aim to evade the IDPS. \n\nSince it is usually not possible to test this capability in a production environment, systems should either be validated in a testing environment or prior to installation. This requirement is usually a function of the design of the IDPS component. Compliance can be verified by acceptance/validation processes or vendor attestation."

Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination and effects of DoS events. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of DoS attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to DoS events."
