Unlimited concurrent connections to MariaDB could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.\n\nThis requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.\n\nThe capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to MariaDB (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to MariaDB by other means.\n\nThe organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.\n\n(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)"

Account management functions can also include assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.\n\nMariaDB must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organizations current account policy. \n\nAutomation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organizations automated account management requirements."

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies.\n\nSuccessful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.\n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.\n\nThis requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If MariaDB does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy."

                "prose": "MariaDB's data-at-rest encryption requires the use of a key management and encryption plugin. These plugins are responsible both for the management of encryption keys and for the actual encryption and decryption of data. MariaDB supports the use of multiple encryption keys. Each encryption key uses a 32-bit integer as a key identifier. If the specific plugin supports key rotation, then encryption keys can also be rotated, which creates a new version of the encryption key. \n\nThe File Key Management plugin that ships with MariaDB is a key management and encryption plugin that reads encryption keys from a plain-text file. Although the plugin's shared library is distributed with MariaDB by default, the plugin is not installed by MariaDB by default. The plugin can be installed by providing the --plugin-load or the --plugin-load-add options. This can be specified as a command-line argument to mysqld or it can be specified in a relevant server option group in an option file. For example:\n[mariadb]\n...\nplugin_load_add = file_key_management\n\nCreating the Key File: To encrypt tables with encryption keys using the File Key Management plugin, first create the file that contains the encryption keys. The file must contain two pieces of information for each encryption key. First, each encryption key must be identified with a 32-bit integer as the key identifier. Second, the encryption key itself must be provided in hex-encoded form. These two pieces of information must be separated by a semicolon. \n\nFor example, the file is formatted in the following way:\n <encryption_key_id1>;<hex-encoded_encryption_key1>\n <encryption_key_id2>;<hex-encoded_encryption_key2>\n\nThe key file can also be optionally encrypted to make it less accessible from the file system. That is explained further in the section below.\n\nThe File Key Management plugin uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt data, which supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit encryption keys. Therefore, the plugin also supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit encryption keys.\n\nRandom encryption keys can be generated using the openssl rand command. For example, to create a random 256-bit (32-byte) encryption key, run the following command:\n\n$ openssl rand -hex 32\na7addd9adea9978fda19f21e6be987880e68ac92632ca052e5bb42b1a506939a\n\nCopy this encryption key to the key file using a text editor, or append a series of keys to a new key file. For example, to append three new encryption keys to a new key file, execute the following:\n\n$ sudo openssl rand -hex 32 >> /etc/mysql/encryption/keyfile\n$ sudo openssl rand -hex 32 >> /etc/mysql/encryption/keyfile\n$ sudo openssl rand -hex 32 >> /etc/mysql/encryption/keyfile\n\nThe new key file would look something like the following after this step:\n\na7addd9adea9978fda19f21e6be987880e68ac92632ca052e5bb42b1a506939a\n49c16acc2dffe616710c9ba9a10b94944a737de1beccb52dc1560abfdd67388b\n8db1ee74580e7e93ab8cf157f02656d356c2f437d548d5bf16bf2a56932954a3\n\nThe key file still needs to have a key identifier for each encryption key added to the beginning of each line. Key identifiers do not need to be contiguous. Open the new key file in the preferred text editor and add the key identifiers. For example, the key file would look something like the following after this step:\n\n1;a7addd9adea9978fda19f21e6be987880e68ac92632ca052e5bb42b1a506939a\n2;49c16acc2dffe616710c9ba9a10b94944a737de1beccb52dc1560abfdd67388b\n100;8db1ee74580e7e93ab8cf157f02656d356c2f437d548d5bf16bf2a56932954a3\n\nThe key identifiers give the user a way to reference the encryption keys from MariaDB. In the example above, encryption keys can be referenced using the key identifiers 1, 2, or 100 with the ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID table option or with system variables such as innodb_default_encryption_key_id. Multiple encryption keys are not always necessary; the encryption key with the key identifier \"1\" is the only mandatory encryption key.\n\nOnce the File Key Management Plugin is enabled, use it by creating an encrypted table:\n\nCREATE TABLE t (i int) ENGINE=InnoDB ENCRYPTED=YES\n\nNow, table t will be encrypted using the encryption key from the key file."

This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.\n\nWith respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.\n\nEven when no such hijacking takes place, invalid input that gets recorded in the database, whether accidental or malicious, reduces the reliability and usability of the system. Available protections include data types, referential constraints, uniqueness constraints, range checking, and application-specific logic. Application-specific logic can be implemented within the database in stored procedures and triggers, where appropriate.\n\nThis calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered."

Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).\n\nWhen dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:\n - Allow strings as input only when necessary. \n - Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.\n - Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.\n - If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equal signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.\n - If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ \n - If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.\n - If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.\n - If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person s name), could also be valid input. \n - If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.\n - Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.\n - Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.\n - Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.\n - Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.\n\nThis calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers.

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions.\n\nWhen discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. \n\nA subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. \n\nThe policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control."

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. \n\nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).\n\nThis requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.\n\nThe application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs)."
