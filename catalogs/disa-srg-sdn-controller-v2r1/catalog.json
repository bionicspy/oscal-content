Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset.\n\nWith a multi-tenant implementation, customers share the network infrastructure and services while they are logically isolated from each other. The controller can provide an abstract view of a virtual network that belongs to each tenant. Hence, a northbound multi-tenancy deployment provides tenants with means to manage and monitor their own virtual networks via a northbound API. The behavior of tenants and their end users should be strictly controlled according to pre-defined access policies.  Role-based access control (RBAC) can be implemented to allow tenants to modify configuration and parameters of the SDN framework that they own and control, while prohibiting access to objects they do not own. Tenants have a self-service model by which they can perform configuration changes, read statistics, and monitor logs that apply only to them. To ensure tenant separation while preserving the integrity and stability of the SDN controller, it is imperative that tenant access to resources within the SDN framework is strictly controlled according to access control policies."

Furthermore, the SDN controller provides flow rules to the SDN-enabled routers and switches to populate their forwarding tables.

Also when reactive flow setup occurs (switch has no flow entry in the forwarding table for specific flow), the controller can respond to the switch to drop the packet or provide the device with a new flow entry.

If the SDN controller were to receive fictitious information from a rogue application or orchestration system, non-optimized network paths would be produced that could disrupt network operations, resulting in inefficient application and business processes. An attacker could also leverage these protocols and attempt to instantiate new flows that could be inadvertently pushed into network devices\u2019 flow-table. The attacker would want to try to spoof new flows to permit specific types of traffic that should be disallowed across the network. If an attacker could create a flow that bypasses the traffic steering that forces traffic through a firewall, the attacker would have a decided advantage. If the attacker can steer traffic in their direction, they may try to leverage that capability to sniff traffic and perform a man-in-the-middle attack."

The messages could be responses from SNMP get requests as well as SNMP notifications (i.e., traps and informs) provided to note changes in node or link state. NETCONF is also used by the SDN controller to configure SDN-enabled devices as well as to receive state and configuration information. Communication between the SDN controller and NETCONF-enabled devices is session based. A session is established for the purpose of exchanging data using remote procedure call (RPC) requests and replies. If the SDN controller were to receive messages from a rogue device using SNMP or NETCONF providing fraud state information or configuration data, the abstract view of the network topology could be altered thereby providing an attacker with the ability to force traffic to bypass security controls or be forwarded using non-optimized paths. To ensure the integrity and authenticity of these messages, it is imperative that they are authenticated prior to processing and taking any action."

In order not to consume the resources of the firewall with clean traffic, the organization may want to choose to redirect the traffic that is outbound from the server to not go through the firewall. Today, zero-trust models are being implemented within the data center; applications and workloads trust no other workload; hence, connectivity between them is not allowed unless explicitly authorized. Each application or workload can have its own security policies. With the advent of cloud networking and multi-tenancy, security policies have evolved to be more workload and application-centric (for example, what type of application, who the tenant is, and which tier of the application is being protected). The SDN Controller must enforce these policies by controlling the forwarding of packets to specific destinations for specific workloads based on the rules provided within the policies."

For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of DoS attacks.
