Without PFS, compromise of one key will compromise all communications.\n\nThe phase 2 (Quick Mode) Security Association (SA) is used to create an IPsec session key. Hence, its rekey or key regeneration procedure is very important. The phase 2 rekey can be performed with or without Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). With PFS, every time a new IPsec Security Association is negotiated during the Quick Mode, a new Diffie-Hellman (DH) exchange occurs. The new DH shared secret will be included with original keying material (SYKEID_d, initiator nonce, and responder nonce} from phase 1 for generating a new IPsec session key. If PFS is not used, the IPsec session key will always be completely dependent on the original keying material from the Phase-1. Hence, if an older key is compromised at any time, it is possible that all new keys may be compromised.\n\nThe DH exchange is performed in the same manner as was done in phase 1 (Main or Aggressive Mode). However, the phase 2 exchange is protected by encrypting the phase 2 packets with the key derived from the phase 1 negotiation. Because DH negotiations during phase 2 are encrypted, the new IPsec session key has an added element of secrecy."

To meet this requirement, the information system must create trusted channels between itself and remote trusted authorized IT product (e.g., syslog server) entities that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications. The information system must create trusted paths between itself and remote administrators and users that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications.\n\nA trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is most often used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC). However, applications that do not use a trusted path are not approved for nonlocal and remote management of DOD information systems.\n\nUse of SSHv2 to establish a trusted channel is approved. Use of FTP, TELNET, HTTP, and SNMPV1 is not approved because they violate the trusted channel rule set. Use of web management tools that are not validated by common criteria may also violate the trusted channel rule set.\n\nWhen there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a certificate authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.\n\nThis requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses. Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement."

                "prose": "Unlike Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) (a simple encapsulating header), L2TP is a full-fledged communications protocol with control channel, data channels, and a robust command structure. In addition to Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), other link layer types (called pseudowires) can be and are defined for delivery in L2TP by separate Internet Engineering Task Force Request for Comments (RFC) documents. Further complexity is created by the capability to define vender-specific parameters beyond those defined in the L2TP specifications.\n\nThe endpoint devices of an L2TP connection can be an L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC), in which case it inputs/outputs the layer 2 protocol to/from the L2TP tunnel. Otherwise, it is an L2TP Network Server (LNS), in which case it inputs/outputs the layer 3 (IP) protocol to/from the L2TP tunnel. The specifications describe three reference models: LAC-LNS, LAC-LAC, and LNS-LNS, the first of which is the most common case. The LAC-LNS model allows a remote access user to reach their home network or internet service provider from a remote location. The remote access user connects to a LAC device, which tunnels the connection home to a waiting LNS. The LAC could also be located on the remote user's laptop, which connects to an LNS at home using a generic internet connection. The other reference models may be used for more obscure scenarios.\n\nAlthough the L2TP protocol does not contain encryption capability, it can be operated over IPsec, which would provide authentication and confidentiality. A remote user in the LAC-LNS model would most likely obtain a dynamically assigned IP address from the home network to ultimately use through the tunnel back to the home network. The outer IP source address used to send the L2TP tunnel packet to the home network is likely to be unknown or highly variable. Also, because the LNS provides the remote user with a dynamic IP address, the firewall at the home network would have to be dynamically updated to accept this address in conjunction with the outer tunnel address. There is also the issue of authentication of the remote user prior to divulging an acceptable IP address. \n\nBecause of all of these complications, the strict filtering rules applied to the IP-in-IP and GRE tunneling cases will likely not be possible in the L2TP scenario.\n\nIn addition to the difficulty of enforcing addresses and endpoints (as explained above), the L2TP protocol itself is a security concern if allowed through a security boundary. In particular:\n\n1. L2TP potentially allows link layer protocols to be delivered from afar. These protocols were intended for link-local scope only and are less defended and not as well known.\n2. The L2TP tunnels can carry IP packets that are very difficult to see and filter because of the additional layer 2 overhead.\n3. L2TP is highly complex and variable (vender-specific variability) and therefore would be a viable target that is difficult to defend. It is better left outside of the main firewall where less damage occurs if the L2TP-processing node is compromised.\n4. Filtering cannot be used to detect and prevent other unintended layer 2 protocols from being tunneled. The strength of the application layer code would have to be relied on to achieve this task.\n5. Regardless of whether the L2TP is handled inside or outside of the main network, a secondary layer of IP filtering is required; therefore, bringing it inside does not save resources.\n\nIt is not recommended to allow unencrypted L2TP packets across the security boundary into the network's protected areas. Reference the Backbone Transport STIG for additional L2TP guidance and use."

Separation of services provides added assurance to the network if the access control server is compromised."

VPN connections that provide user access to the network are the prime candidates for VPN session termination and are the primary focus of this requirement.\n\nTo determine if and when the VPN connections warrant termination, the organization must perform a risk assessment to identify the use case for the VPN and determine if periodic VPN session termination puts the mission at significant risk.\n\nThe organization must document the results and the determination of the risk assessment in the VPN section of the System Security Plan. The organization must also configure VPN session terminations in accordance with the risk assessment.\n\nTerminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. Quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. \n\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. \n\nThis requirement applies to any network element that tracks individual sessions (e.g., stateful inspection firewall, ALG, or VPN)."

With split tunneling enabled, a remote client has access to the internet while at the same time has established a secured path to the enclave via an IPsec tunnel. A remote client connected to the internet that has been compromised by an attacker on the internet provides an attack base to the enclave's private network via the IPsec tunnel.

IKE peers will negotiate the encryption algorithm and authentication or hashing methods as well as generate the encryption keys.\n\nAn IPsec SA is established using either IKE or manual configuration. When using IKE, the security associations are established when needed and expire after a period of time or volume of traffic threshold. If manually configured, they are established as soon as the configuration is complete at both end points, and they do not expire. When using IKE, the Security Parameter Index (SPI) for each security association is a pseudo-randomly derived number.\n\nWith manual configuration of the IPsec security association, both the cipher key and authentication key are static. Hence, if the keys are compromised, the traffic being protected by the current IPsec tunnel can be decrypted as well as traffic in any future tunnels established by this SA. Furthermore, the peers are not authenticated prior to establishing the SA, which could result in a rogue device establishing an IPsec SA with either of the VPN endpoints.\n\nIKE provides primary authentication to verify the identity of the remote system before negotiation begins. This feature is lost when the IPsec security associations are manually configured, which results in a nonterminating session using static preshared keys.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-NET-000512-VPN-002220, SRG-NET-000132-VPN-000460, SRG-NET-000147-VPN-000530"
