VTP pruning preserves bandwidth by preventing VLAN traffic (unknown MAC, broadcast, multicast) from being sent down trunk links when not needed, that is, there are no access switch ports in neighboring switches belonging to such VLANs. An attack can force a digest change for the VTP domain enabling a rogue device to become the VTP server, which could allow unauthorized access to previously blocked VLANs or allow the addition of unauthorized switches into the domain.

When a router has an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) entry for a destination host and forwards it to the access layer switch and there is no entry corresponding to the frame's destination MAC address in the incoming VLAN, the frame will be sent to all forwarding ports within the respective VLAN, which causes flooding. Large amounts of flooded traffic can saturate low bandwidth links, causing network performance issues or complete connectivity outage to the connected devices. Unknown unicast flooding has been a problem in networks that have asymmetric routing and default timers. To mitigate the risk of a connectivity outage, the Unknown Unicast Flood Blocking (UUFB) feature must be implemented on all access layer switches. The UUFB feature will block unknown unicast traffic flooding and only permit egress traffic with MAC addresses that are known to exit on the port.\n\nFor Cisco ACI, L2 Unknown Unicast decides whether the bridge domain should flood packets that are destined to an unknown MAC address (Flood) or should send it to a spine node for COOP database lookup (Hardware Proxy)."

To compound the problem, the inability of organizational officials to obtain timely information about disruptions or to provide timely direction to operational elements after a communication path incident, can impact the ability of the organization to respond to such incidents in a timely manner. Establishing alternate communication paths for command and control purposes, including designating alternative decision makers if primary decision makers are unavailable and establishing the extent and limitations of their actions, can greatly facilitate the organization's ability to continue to operate and take appropriate actions during an incident.\n\nTo establish alternate communication paths for system operations and organizational command and control within a Cisco ACI cluster using the CLI, configure a multi-pod ACI architecture with separate APIC clusters, ensuring redundancy across pods by using external IP-routed networks (Inter-Pod Network) to maintain connectivity even if one pod experiences a failure.
