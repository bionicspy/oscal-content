                "prose": "Unlike GRE (a simple encapsulating header) L2TP is a full-fledged communications protocol with control channel, data channels, and a robust command structure. In addition to PPP, other link layer types (called pseudowires) can be and are defined for delivery in L2TP by separate RFC documents. Further complexity is created by the capability to define vender-specific parameters beyond those defined in the L2TP specifications.\n\nThe endpoint devices of an L2TP connection can be an L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) in which case it inputs/outputs the layer 2 protocol to/from the L2TP tunnel. Otherwise, it is an L2TP Network Server (LNS), in which case it inputs/outputs the layer 3 (IP) protocol to/from the L2TP tunnel. The specifications describe three reference models: LAC-LNS, LAC-LAC, and LNS-LNS, the first of which is the most common case. The LAC-LNS model allows a remote access user to reach his home network or ISP from a remote location. The remote access user connects to  a LAC device which tunnels his connection home to an awaiting LNS. The LAC could also be located on the remote user's laptop, which connects to an LNS at home using some generic internet connection. The other reference models may be used for more obscure scenarios.\n\nAlthough the L2TP protocol does not contain encryption capability, it can be operated over IPsec, which would provide authentication and confidentiality. A remote user in the LAC-LNS model would most likely obtain a dynamically assigned IP address from the home network to ultimately use through the tunnel back to the home network. Secondly, the outer IP source address used to send the L2TP tunnel packet to the home network is likely to be unknown or highly variable. Thirdly, since the LNS provides the remote user with a dynamic IP address to use, the firewall at the home network would have to be dynamically updated to accept this address in conjunction with the outer tunnel address. Finally, there is also the issue of authentication of the remote user prior to divulging an acceptable IP address. Because of all of these complications, the strict filtering rules applied to the IP-in-IP and GRE tunneling cases will likely not be possible in the L2TP scenario.\n\nIn addition to the difficulty of enforcing addresses and endpoints (as explained above), the L2TP protocol itself is a security concern if allowed through a security boundary. In particular:\n\n1) L2TP potentially allows link layer protocols to be delivered from afar. These protocols were intended for link-local scope only, are less defended, and not as well-known,\n2) The L2TP tunnels can carry IP packets that are very difficult to see and filter because of the additional layer 2 overhead,\n3) L2TP is highly complex and variable (vender-specific variability) and therefore would be a viable target that is difficult to defend. It is better left outside of the main firewall where less damage occurs if the L2TP-processing node is compromised,\n4) Filtering cannot be used to detect and prevent other unintended layer 2 protocols from being tunneled. The strength of the application layer code would have to be relied on to achieve this task,\n5) Regardless of whether the L2TP is handled inside or outside of the main network, a secondary layer of IP filtering is required; therefore bringing it inside does not save resources.\n\nTherefore, it is not recommended to allow unencrypted L2TP packets across the security boundary into the network's protected areas. Reference the Backbone Transport STIG for additional L2TP guidance and use."

Use of password for user remote access for non-privileged account is not authorized.\n\nFactors include:\n(i) Something you know (e.g., password/PIN);\n(ii) Something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or\n(iii) Something you are (e.g., biometric).\n\nA non-privileged account is any information system account with authorizations of a non-privileged user.\n\nNetwork access is any access to a network element by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network.\n\nThe DoD CAC with DoD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication."

To meet this requirement, the information system must create trusted channels between itself and remote trusted authorized IT product (e.g., syslog server) entities that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications. The information system must create trusted paths between itself and remote administrators and users that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications.\n\nA trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is most often used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. However, applications that do not use a trusted path are not approved for non-local and remote management of DoD information systems.\n\nUse of SSHv2 to establish a trusted channel is approved. Use of FTP, TELNET, HTTP, and SNMPV1 is not approved since they violate the trusted channel rule set. Use of web management tools that are not validated by common criteria may also violate the trusted channel rule set.\n\nWhen there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.\n\nThis requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses. Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement."

Log processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the log capturing mechanisms, and log storage capacity being reached or exceeded.\n\nWhile this requirement also applies to the event monitoring system (e.g., Syslog, Security Information and Event Management [SIEM], or SNMP servers), the VPN Gateway must also be configured to generate a message to the administrator console.\n\nThe VPN daemon facility and log facility are messages in the log, which capture actions performed or errors encountered by system processes."

The SA is less secure with a longer lifetime because an attacker has a greater opportunity to collect traffic encrypted by the same key and subject it to cryptanalysis.

Without PFS, compromise of one key will compromise all communications.\n\nThe phase 2 (Quick Mode) Security Association (SA) is used to create an IPsec session key. Hence, its rekey or key regeneration procedure is very important. The phase 2 rekey can be performed with or without PFS. With PFS, every time a new IPsec Security Association is negotiated during the Quick Mode, a new Diffie-Hellman (DH) exchange occurs. The new DH shared secret will be included with original keying material (SYKEID_d, initiator nonce, and responder nonce) from phase 1 for generating a new IPsec session key. If PFS is not used, the IPsec session key will always be completely dependent on the original keying material from the Phase-1. Hence, if an older key is compromised at any time, it is possible that all new keys may be compromised.\n\nThe DH exchange is performed in the same manner as was done in phase 1 (Main or Aggressive Mode). However, the phase 2 exchange is protected by encrypting the phase 2 packets with the key derived from the phase 1 negotiation. Because DH negotiations during phase 2 are encrypted, the new IPsec session key has an added element of secrecy."

If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Use of passwords for authentication is intended only for limited situations and should not be used as a replacement for two-factor CAC-enabled authentication.\n\nAlthough allowed by SP800-131Ar2 for some applications, SHA-1 is considered a compromised hashing standard and is being phased out of use by industry and Government standards. Unless required for legacy use, DoD systems should not be configured to use SHA-2 for integrity of remote access sessions.\n\nThe information system must specify the hash algorithm used for authenticating passwords. Implementation of this requirement requires configuration of FIPS-approved cipher block algorithm and block cipher modes for encryption.\n\nPre-shared key cipher suites may only be used in networks where both the client and server belong to the same organization. Cipher suites using pre-shared keys shall not be used with TLS 1.0 or 1.1 and shall not be used with TLS 1.2 when a Government client or server communicates with non-government systems."

IKE peers will negotiate the encryption algorithm and authentication or hashing methods as well as generate the encryption keys.\n\nAn IPsec SA is established using either Internet Key Exchange (IKE) or manual configuration. When using IKE, the security associations are established when needed and expire after a period of time or volume of traffic threshold. If manually configured, they are established as soon as the configuration is complete at both end points and they do not expire. When using IKE, the Security Parameter Index (SPI) for each security association is a pseudo-randomly derived number.\n\nWith manual configuration of the IPsec security association, both the cipher key and authentication key are static. Hence, if the keys are compromised, the traffic being protected by the current IPsec tunnel can be decrypted as well as traffic in any future tunnels established by this SA. Furthermore, the peers are not authenticated prior to establishing the SA, which could result in a rogue device establishing an IPsec SA with either of the VPN end points.\n\nIKE provides primary authentication to verify the identity of the remote system before negotiation begins. This feature is lost when the IPsec security associations are manually configured, which results in a non-terminating session using static pre-shared keys."

If PSKs are not encrypted, they can be plainly read and easily compromised. Use of passwords for authentication is intended only for limited situations and must not be used as a replacement for two-factor CAC-enabled authentication.\n\nNIST SP 800-52 Rev 2 provides guidance for using pre-shared keys with VPN gateways. PSKs may only be used in networks where both the client and server belong to the same organization.\n\nPSKs used for site-to-site VPNs are considered by the SRG as a type of password. If this shared secret is already encrypted and not in plaintext, this meets this requirement. This requirement requires configuration of FIPS-approved cipher block algorithm and block cipher modes for encryption. This method uses a one-way hashing encryption algorithm with a salt value to validate a user's password without having to store the actual password. Performance and time required to access are factors that must be considered, and the one-way hash is the most feasible means of securing the password and providing an acceptable measure of password security.\n\nUse a keyed hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC calculates a message authentication code via a cryptographic hash function used in conjunction with an encryption key. The key must be protected as with any private key."

                "prose": "Without device-to-device authentication, communications with malicious devices may be established. Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk.\n\nSNMPv3 supports authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy, while previous versions of the protocol contained well-known security weaknesses, which were easily exploited. SNMPv3 can be configured for identification and bidirectional, cryptographically based authentication.\n\nA typical SNMP implementation includes three components: managed device, SNMP agent, and NMS. The SNMP agent is the SNMP process that resides on the managed device and communicates with the network management system. The NMS is a combination of hardware and software that is used to monitor and administer a network. The SNMP data is stored in a highly structured, hierarchical format known as a management information base (MIB). The SNMP manager collects information about network connectivity, activity, and events by polling managed devices.\n\nSNMPv3 defines a user-based security model (USM), and a view-based access control model (VACM). SNMPv3 USM provides data integrity, data origin authentication, message replay protection, and protection against disclosure of the message payload. SNMPv3 VACM provides access control to determine whether a specific type of access (read or write) to the management information is allowed. Implement both VACM and USM for full protection.\n\nSNMPv3 server services must not be configured on products whose primary purpose is not to provide SNMP services. SNMP client services may be configured on the VPN gateway, application, or operating system to allow limited monitoring or querying of the device from by an SNMP server for management purposes. SNMP of any version will not be used to make configuration changes to the device. SNMPv3 must be disabled by default and enabled only if used. SNMP v3 provides security feature enhancements to SNMP, including encryption and message authentication.\n\nCurrently, the AES cipher block algorithm can be used for both applying cryptographic protection (e.g., encryption) and removing or verifying the protection that was previously applied (e.g., decryption) in DoD. The use of FIPS-approved algorithms for both cryptographic mechanisms is required. If any version of SNMP is used for remote administration, default SNMP community strings such as \"public\" and \"private\" should be removed before real community strings are put into place. If the defaults are not removed, an attacker could retrieve real community strings from the device using the default string."

VPN connections that provide user access to the network are the prime candidates for VPN session termination and are the primary focus of this requirement.\n\nTo determine if and when the VPN connections warrant termination, the organization must perform a risk assessment to identify the use case for the VPN and determine if periodic VPN session termination puts the mission at significant risk.\n\nThe organization must document the results and the determination of the risk assessment in the VPN section of the SSP. The organization must also configure VPN session terminations in accordance with the risk assessment.\nTerminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. \n\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system level network connection. \n\nThis requirement applies to any network element that tracks individual sessions (e.g., stateful inspection firewall, ALG, or VPN)."

If the CA used for verifying the certificate is not a DOD-approved CA, trust of this CA has not been established.\n\nThe DOD will only accept PKI certificates obtained from a DOD-approved internal or external Certificate Authority. Reliance on CAs for the establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of TLS certificates. Reliance on CAs for the establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of Internet Key Exchange (IKE).\n\nThis requirement focuses on communications protection for the application session rather than for the network packet. VPN gateways that perform these functions must be able to identify which session identifiers were generated when the sessions were established.
