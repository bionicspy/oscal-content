To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies.\n\nSuccessful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.\n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.\n\nThis requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If Azure SQL Database does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy."

Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message. \n\nNonrepudiation protects against later claims by a user of not having created, modified, or deleted a particular data item or collection of data in the database. \n\nIn designing a database, the organization must define the types of data and the user actions that must be protected from repudiation. The implementation must then include building audit features into the application data tables and configuring the DBMS's audit tools to capture the necessary audit trail. Design and implementation also must ensure that applications pass individual user identification to the DBMS, even where the application connects to the DBMS with a standard, shared account. \n\nIf the computer account of a remote computer is granted access to SQL Server, any service or scheduled task running as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM or NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE can log into the instance and perform actions. These actions cannot be traced back to a specific user or process."

A schema is a named container for database objects, which allows the user group objects into separate namespaces.\n\nWhere possible, locate security-related database objects and code in a separate database, schema, or other separate security domain from database objects and code implementing application logic. In all cases, use GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, ALTER ROLE \u2026 ADD MEMBER \u2026 and/or ALTER ROLE \u2026. DROP MEMBER statements to add and remove permissions on server-level and database-level security-related objects to provide effective isolation."

This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.\n\nWith respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.\n\nEven when no such hijacking takes place, invalid input that gets recorded in the database, whether accidental or malicious, reduces the reliability and usability of the system. Available protections include data types, referential constraints, uniqueness constraints, range checking, and application-specific logic. Application-specific logic can be implemented within the database in stored procedures and triggers, where appropriate.\n\nThis calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed, and must document what has been discovered."

Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).\n\nWhen dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:\n-- Allow strings as input only when necessary. \n-- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.\n-- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.\n-- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.\n-- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ \n-- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.\n-- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.\n-- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input. \n-- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.\n-- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.\n-- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.\n-- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.\n-- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.\n\nThis calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers.

Ownership is usually acquired implicitly when creating the object or by explicit ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control and the permissions related to that access. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions.\n\nWhen DAC policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects.\n\nA subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.\n\nThe policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of DCA require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control."

It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code.
